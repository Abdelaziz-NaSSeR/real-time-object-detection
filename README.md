# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles üöóüîç  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a real-time object detection system for autonomous vehicles. Using deep learning, we aim to accurately detect and classify objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles in various driving environments. The system will enhance road safety and decision-making in self-driving technology.
