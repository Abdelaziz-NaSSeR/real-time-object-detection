# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## Project Name
**Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles**

## Team Members
- **Abdelaziz Nasser Abdelaziz Mohamed** (Team Leader)
- **Mayar Alaa Aldin Mohran**
- **Ghada Nasser Amin**
- **Basma Ahmed Mahmoud**
- **Mohamed Elshahat Mohamed**

## Project Idea
This project aims to develop a **real-time object detection system** for autonomous vehicles. The system will identify, classify, and track objects such as **pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles** using deep learning techniques and computer vision.

## Project Description
Autonomous vehicles require advanced perception systems to ensure safe navigation. This project will implement an object detection model that processes **live camera feeds** and detects objects in real time. A **pre-trained deep learning model** (such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN) will be utilized to enhance accuracy and efficiency, making the vehicle capable of making informed decisions.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning
  - NumPy & Pandas for data handling
  - Matplotlib for visualization
- **Development Tools:**
  - VS Code for coding
  - GitHub for version control
  - FastAPI for API development (if applicable)
- **Hardware Requirements:**
  - GPU (recommended for model training)
  - Camera for real-time testing

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
### **Functional Requirements:**
- Detect objects in real time.
- Classify objects into predefined categories (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.).
- Provide confidence scores for detected objects.
- Work with both live camera feeds and recorded video.

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Minimize processing latency.
- Scale to different camera resolutions.
- Optimize performance for GPUs and edge devices.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for monitoring detections.

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abdelaziz-NaSSeR/real-time-object-detection.git
   cd real-time-object-detection
